        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework.</li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage, they are also used to divide the content on the webpage and describe the content to browseres and developers.</li>
          <li>HTML code consists of three main parts: Head, body, and footer.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, and helps render the webpage correctly. Elements within the head element are not visible to users when looking at a webpage (with exception to the "title" element).</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements a developer wants the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copy right, contact, sitemap, and navigation information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used to to define how webpage content is presented to users. The three styles of CSS are Inline CSS, Internal Style Sheet, and External Style Sheet (most preferred way to style).</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. It can be used to make quick and permanent changes but is less flexible because they must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>An Internal Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and ID's which are used to identify elements in order to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>An External Style Sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A link element is used to link CSS rules to a file and is placed in the HTML's head section by placing the LINK element after the META DATA and before the TITLE element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A declaration contains two important components: CSS property we want to apply, and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Remember that every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
          <li>The * is a wild card symbol that is used to apply a rule to ALL the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Avoid DRY(Do Not Repeat Yourself) codes by combining multiple selectors into a single CSS rule using commas, thus allowing the declaration to affect all selectors.</li>
          <li>Text-align is a positioning property, one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The image selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property assigned with a BLOCK value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute within a class selector. </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of projects.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>A repository is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Git allows you to work on branches or workspaces in which you can make changes that will not effect the live site.</li>
          <li>Changes made to a file within the repository (repo), are called Commits.</li>
