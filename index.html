        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is used to give the content structure by using ELEMENTS which work 
            together to provide content and basic framework.</li>
          <li>ELEMENTS can provide two types of information. There are those that add content on a webpage like text, image, header, 
            and list elements. There are also elements used to divide content on the webpage and describe the content to browsers and 
            developers, these are know as META-RELATED, CONTENT DIVISION, and SEMANTIC elements.</li>
          <li>In SEMANTIC HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. It is important 
            to use these elements, when possible, to make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>Element and tag are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world and it is important to know the difference. An 
              element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle 
              brackets.</li>
          <li>An HTML ATTRIBUTE defines additional information about an element and are always defined in the beginnig element, never the 
                closing element. EX: html lang="en" tells the browser the language (en = ENGLISH) for the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML code consists of three main parts: HEAD, BODY, and FOOTER:</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage and helps render the webpage correctly. Elements within the head element 
            contain information used to effectively serve our webpage to users, known as METADATA. These elements are not visible to users when 
            looking at a webpage (with exception to the title element).</li>
            <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. It is required and extremely important for SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION(SEO).</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements a 
            developer wants the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <li>Elements nested inside other elements are known as CHILD ELEMENTS, where the element that holds all the "children" are know as 
              the PARENT element. The body element is a great example of a parent element. This parent/child language is often used by 
              developers.</li>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of HEADING a given text block represents. They must be used in order 
              from 1 to 6 to make the page accessible to users on other devices such as screen readers. The h1 (biggest heading) should only be 
              used once on each page.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. An important attribute within the image 
                element is the src attribute, which defines the location of the image. Another attribute you'll want to use is the alt attribute, 
                which contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image (important for screen readers and other 
                assisitive technologies).</li>
            <li>The a element stands for ANCHOR and it creates a link to the same webpage or other webpages. A common attribute used with the a 
                  element is the href attribute which points to the URL for the link.</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, odered lists, and list items, respectively.</li>
            <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. This is used to wrap most of the text on yor webpages.</li>
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or LINE BREAK, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>Finally, the footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copy right, contact, sitemap, and 
            navigation information.</li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is a programming language used to to define how webpage content is presented to users. 
            The three styles of CSS are Inline CSS, Internal Style Sheet, and External Style Sheet (most preferred way to style).</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. They apply to a specific HTML tag, using a 
            style attribute with a CSS rule to style a paticular page element only. It can be used to make quick and permanent changes but is 
            less flexible because they must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>An Internal Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, 
            and you can configure CSS classes and ID's which are used to identify elements in order to style multiple elements in the page 
            code. in essence, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>An External Style Sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier.</li>
            <li>*NOTE - An external style sheet is an example of SEPERATION OF CONCERNS, which is a widely used trm in web development referring to 
            seperating code into different files based on use. Based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibilty.</li>
            <li>A CSS rule consists of a SELECTOR followed by at least one DECLARATION (in curly brackets). EX: div {color: blue; text-align: 
              justify;}.</li>
            <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
            <li>The image selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
            <li>A declaration contains two important components: the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of that property. 
              EX: {color: blue}. *NOTE - when assigning color values in CSS, you can use semantic references (name of color) or it's hexidecimal 
              code or hex#.</li>
            <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element. Setting this property to 0 indicates we want 
              NO extra space around the element.</li>
            <li>A padding property indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element, making the entire element bigger.</li>
            <li>A text-align property is used for positioning, one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
            <li>The display property assigned with a block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
            <li>It is helpful to remember that every HTML element is essentially a box. With the content in the center, surrounded by the padding 
            property, then the border property, and finally the margin property.</li>
          <li>The * is a wild card symbol that is used to apply a rule to ALL the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>*NOTE - Avoid DRY(Do Not Repeat Yourself) codes by combining multiple selectors into a single CSS rule using commas, thus allowing 
            the declaration to affect all selectors.</li>
          <li>CLASS ATTRIBUTEs allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute within a class 
            selector. Then the attribute can be assigned to the element in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the 
            CSS rule.</li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
            <li>The href attribute uses a relative path, meaning the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file and is placed in the HTML's head section. It is important to place the 
              link after the META DATA and before the title element. Combining the link element with the rel attribute and href attribute allows 
            us to link the CSS rules to the HTML file. EX: link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" (contained in angle brackets).</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of projects. It uses a cloud-based hosting service called GitHub, 
            that allows developers to keep track of projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Git and GitHub allow developers to 
            create and merge branches.</li>
            <li>A REPOSITORY is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
            <li>Changes made to a file within the repository (repo), are called COMMITS. When we COMMIT CHANGES, we are saving a record of a 
              change made to a file within the repo.</li>
            <li>A BRANCH is a workspace in which you can make changes that wont effect the live site. There is a typically a DEFAULT, MASTER, 
              or MAIN branch when working on a project.</li>
            A <li>FEATURE branch is used to add a new feature or functionality.</li>
            <li>PULL REQUEST (PR) - the way to ask for changes made to a branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss, and review 
              work being done.</li>
            <li>A MERGE happens after a PR is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one brach to another and then deployed on 
              the live site</li>
            <li>ISSUES are how work is tracked when using Git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users 
              to track progress on a project form beginning to end.</li>
            <li></li>
          <li>When using git commands in GitBash, you must begin the command with git.</li> 
          <li>The GitHub Flow is a series of steps a developer takes to safely work on a project. This allows multiple developers to work on code 
            within the same project without running into syncing issues. The steps are as follows:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigate to the directory you wish to work in using the cd command.</li>
              <li>Create a feature branch to store your edits by using command - git checkout -b feature/name-of-feature.</li>
              <li>Make sure you are now working in that branch by using command - git status</li>
              <li>Once you are finished making edits to your code in VS Code, commit all changes to your feature branch using command - git 
                add -A</li>
              <li>Add a commit message using command - git commit -m "your message here". Commit messages should be a single line 
                (less than 50 characters) and describes the changes CONCISELY. COMMIT OFTEN!.</li>
              <li>Sync the current version of the remote main or default branch (to avoid any sync version errors) to your local feature branch 
                by using command - git pull origin main. *NOTE - make sure you are in the feature branch and NOT the main branch when doing 
                this!</li>
              <li>Once the remote main branch is synced, push all your feature branches to the remote feature branch in the GitHub repository 
                by using command - git push origin feature/name-of-feature</li>
              <li>Go to the GitHub repository and navigate to the directory your project is under. From there, change the main branch to the 
                feature branch and check that all your changes are there.</li>
              <li>Create a pull request (PR) by selecting the Compare & Pull Request button.</li>
              <li>Give the PR a short but descriptive title. In the body of the PR, add instructions for team members that will review the PR 
                about what changes were made, how the feature is supposed to function, and how to start the application so the feature can be 
                tested.</li>
              <li>Designate the base branch as the main or default branch, and the comparison branch as the feature/name-of-branch you 
                created.</li>
              <li>Select Create Pull Request.</li>
              <li>If working collaboratively, request one or two other team members to review the code before it is merged into the base branch.</li>
              <li>Once the PR is approved (or you are working solo and approve it your self), merge the PR by selecting Merge Pull Request.</li>
              <li>Once the PR is succesfully merged, it is good practice to close out the feature branch you created so as not to confuse other 
                team members throughout the project.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript(JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. It allows you to power 
            your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces(API) - are built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating 
            HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio 
            samples.</li>
          <li>Third party API's allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, like Twitter and 
            Facebook.</li>
          <li>A VARIABLE is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A STRING is a type of variable that uses a sequence of text enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A CONSOLE refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code functionality.</li>
          <li>A METHOD is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. EX: The '.log("your message")' method will out-put whatever 
            we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>To link a ".js" file to the HTML file, add script src = "./yourfoldername.js" (placed between angle brackets) under the footer element 
            and above the closing body element.</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools is an indespensible developer tool that will be used throughout bootcamp and your professional career. It can be 
            accessed by righ-clicking the screen in your browser and selecting INSPECT, or by pressing the CTRL+SHFT+I keys.</li>
          <li>CONTROL FLOW is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, code runs from top to bottom. *NOTE - make sure you 
            define your variables before referencing using a method.</li>
          <li>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS and LOOPS can be used to control the order in which code is executed, or even at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way introducing decision making into our code, and else if can be used for more than one condition. This type 
            of statement allows the computer to check if the condition provided is TRUTHY (True), if so it will perform whatever action the code 
            asks. If it is FALSY (untrue), the computer will ignore whate we asked.</li>
          <li>The STRICT EQUALITY OPERATOR === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result TRUE if the values are equal 
            and FALSE if they are not.</li>
          <li>An ARRAY is a variable used to store a group of related data. EX: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];. Arrays 
            can also store different types of data such as strings "", numbers, boolean, etc.</li>
          <li>An INDEX locates an individual data item inside an array with a unique number (location number). To access one item in an array, 
            start with the variable name followed by the index number of that item in []. EX: shapes[0]. *NOTE - JS as well as many other 
            languages are ZERO-INDEXED and sequential, which means they start at zero and increase by 1 for each item.</li>
          <li>The for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block 
            to be executed over and over again.</li>
          <li>A for loop consists of three inportant statements. The first determines the starting point for our loop. EX: var x = 0;. The second is 
            the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. Use the 
            LENGTH property to allow the array to execute once for each item in the array. EX: x < shapes.length;. The third is what allows the 
            array to iterate over each item. Since indices are predictable, we know the number increases by 1. EX: x++</li>
          <li>COMMENTING OUT CODE makes a code inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of Js 
            code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A FUNCTION is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It must be called by name in order 
            to execute and does not automatically execute like a FOR loop or conditional statement.</li>
          <li>There are two requirements for a JS function: 1 - Define the function and 2 - Call the function by its name for it to execute. A 
            FUNCTION DECLARATION uses the function keyword in teh function name to define the function. EX: function makeTea() { // code block }. 
            CODE BLOCK or FUNCTION BODY is where we write out instructions for what the function should do. CALL THE FUNCTION to execute or run 
            the function by writing the function name followed by parentheses. EX: makeTea();.</li>
          <li>When debugging your code - follow these tips for common errors: Check variable names to make sure they match the function name, - 
            Check that the index is defined within the {} of the function, - Remeber JS executes from top to bottom, and variables must be defined 
            before other code referencing them.</li>
