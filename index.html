        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework.</li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage, they are also used to divide the content on the webpage and describe the content to browseres and developers.</li>
          <li>HTML code consists of three main parts: Head, body, and footer.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, and helps render the webpage correctly. Elements within the head element are not visible to users when looking at a webpage (with exception to the "title" element).</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements a developer wants the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copy right, contact, sitemap, and navigation information.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of projects.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>A repository is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Git allows you to work on branches or workspaces in which you can make changes that will not effect the live site.</li>
          <li>Changes made to a file within the repository (repo), are called Commits.</li>
