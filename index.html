        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is used to give the content structure by using ELEMENTS which work 
            together to provide content and basic framework.</li>
          <li>ELEMENTS can provide two types of information. There are those that add content on a webpage like text, image, header, 
            and list elements. There are also elements used to divide content on the webpage and describe the content to browsers and 
            developers, these are know as META-RELATED, CONTENT DIVISION, and SEMANTIC elements.</li>
          <li>In SEMANTIC HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. It is important 
            to use these elements, when possible, to make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>HTML code consists of three main parts: HEAD, BODY, and FOOTER: The head element contains information about the webpage 
            and helps render the webpage correctly. Elements within the head element contain information used to effectively serve our 
            webpage to users, known as METADATA. These elements are not visible to users when looking at a webpage (with exception to the 
            title element). The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements a developer wants the user 
            to see and interact with must be placed inside this element. Finally, the footer element appears at the bottom of the page and 
            usually contains the author, copy right, contact, sitemap, and navigation information.</li>
          <li>An HTML ATTRIBUTE defines additional information about an element and are always defined in the beginnig element, never the 
            closing element. EX: html lang="en" tells the browser that the language (en = ENGLISH) for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. It is required and extremely important for SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION(SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The section element is a semantic element that defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are known as CHILD ELEMENTS, where the element that holds all the "children" are know as 
            the PARENT element. The body element is a great example of a parent element. This parent/child language is often used by 
            developers.</li>
          <li>Element and tag are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world and it is important to know the difference. An 
            element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle 
            brackets.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of HEADING a given text block represents. They must be used in order 
            from 1 to 6 to make the page accessible to users on other devices such as screen readers. The h1 (biggest heading) should only be 
            used once on each page.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. This is used to wrap most of the text on yor webpages.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, odered lists, and list items, respectively.</li>
          <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. An important attribute within the image 
            element is the src attribute, which defines the location of the image. Another attribute you'll want to use is the alt attribute, 
            which contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image (important for screen readers and other 
            assisitive technologies).</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or LINE BREAK, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element stands for ANCHOR and it creates a link to the same webpage or other webpages. A common attribute used with the a 
            element is the href attribute which points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used to to define how webpage content is presented to users. The three styles of CSS are Inline CSS, 
            Internal Style Sheet, and External Style Sheet (most preferred way to style).</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. It can be used to make quick and permanent 
            changes but is less flexible because they must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>An Internal Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, 
            and you can configure CSS classes and ID's which are used to identify elements in order to style multiple elements in the page 
            code.</li>
          <li>An External Style Sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A link element is used to link CSS rules to a file and is placed in the HTML's head section by placing the LINK element after the 
            META DATA and before the TITLE element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A declaration contains two important components: CSS property we want to apply, and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Remember that every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
          <li>The * is a wild card symbol that is used to apply a rule to ALL the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Avoid DRY(Do Not Repeat Yourself) codes by combining multiple selectors into a single CSS rule using commas, thus allowing the 
            declaration to affect all selectors.</li>
          <li>Text-align is a positioning property, one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The image selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property assigned with a BLOCK value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute within a class 
            selector. </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of projects.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored 
            remotely.</li>
          <li>A repository is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Git allows you to work on branches or workspaces in which you can make changes that will not effect the live site.</li>
          <li>Changes made to a file within the repository (repo), are called Commits.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript(JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. IT allows you to power 
            your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces(API) - are built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating 
            HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3d graphics and audio 
            samples.</li>
          <li>Third party API's allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, like Twitter and 
            Facebook.</li>
          <li>A VARIABLE is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A STRING is a type of variable that uses a sequence of text enclosed in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A CONSOLE refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code functionality.</li>
          <li>A METHOD is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. EX: The '.log("your message")' method will out-put whatever 
            we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>To link a ".js" file to the HTML file, add script src = "./yourfoldername.js"(placed between arrows) under the FOOTER element and 
            above the closing element for BODY.</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools is an indespensibledeveloper's tool that will be used throughout bootcamp and your professional career. It can be 
            accessed by righ-clicking the screen in your browser and selecting INSPECT, or by pressing the CTRL+SHFT+I keys.</li>
          <li>CONTROL FLOW is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, code runs from top to bottom. *NOTE - make sure you 
            define your variables before referencing using a method.</li>
          <li>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS and LOOPS can be used to control the order in which code is executed, or even at all.</li>
          <li>An IF statement is a way introducing decision making into our code, and ELSE IF can be used for more than one condition. This type 
            of statement allows the computer to check if the condition provided is TRUTHY (True), if so it will perform whatever action the code 
            asks. If it is FALSY (untrue), the computer will ignore whate we asked.</li>
          <li>The STRICT EQUALITY OPERATOR === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result TRUE if the values are equal 
            and FALSE if they are not.</li>
          <li>An ARRAY is a variable used to store a group of related data. EX: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];. Arrays 
            can also store different types of data such as strings "", numbers, boolean, etc.</li>
          <li>An INDEX locates an individual data item inside an array with a unique number (location number). To access one item in an array, 
            start with the variable name followed by the index number of that item in []. EX: shapes[0]. *NOTE - JS as wella s many other 
            languages are ZERO-INDEXED and sequential, which means they start at zero and increase by 1 for each item.</li>
          <li>The FOR loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block 
            to be executed over and over again.</li>
          <li>For loops consist of three inportant statements. The first determines the starting point for our loop. EX: var x = 0;. The second is 
            the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. Use the 
            LENGTH property to allow the array to execute once for each item in the array. EX: x < shapes.length;. The third is what allows the 
            array to iterate over each item. Since indices are predictable, we know the number increases by 1. EX: x++</li>
          <li>COMMENTING OUT CODE makes a code inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of Js 
            code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A FUNCTION is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It must be called by name in order 
            to execute and does not automatically execute like a FOR loop or conditional statement.</li>
          <li>There are two requirements for a JS function: 1 - Define the function and 2 - Call the function by its name for it to execute. A 
            FUNCTION DECLARATION uses the function keyword in teh function name to define the function. EX: function makeTea() { // code block }. 
            CODE BLOCK or FUNCTION BODY is where we write out instructions for what the function should do. CALL THE FUNCTION to execute or run 
            the function by writing the function name followed by parentheses. EX: makeTea();.</li>
          <li>When debugging your code - follow these tips for common errors: Check variable names to make sure they match the function name, - 
            Check that the index is defined within the {} of the function, - Remeber JS executes from top to bottom, and variables must be defined 
            before other code referencing them.</li>
