        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework.</li>
          <li>Elements are a type of content on a webpage, they are also used to divide the content on the webpage and describe the content to browseres and developers.</li>
          <li>HTML code consists of three main parts: Head, body, and footer.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, and helps render the webpage correctly. Elements within the head element are not visible to users when looking at a webpage (with exception to the "title" element).</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements a developer wants the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copy right, contact, sitemap, and navigation information.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used to to define how webpage content is presented to users. The three styles of CSS are Inline CSS, Internal Style Sheet, and External Style Sheet (most preferred way to style).</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file. It can be used to make quick and permanent changes but is less flexible because they must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>An Internal Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and ID's which are used to identify elements in order to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>An External Style Sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A link element is used to link CSS rules to a file and is placed in the HTML's head section by placing the LINK element after the META DATA and before the TITLE element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A declaration contains two important components: CSS property we want to apply, and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Remember that every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
          <li>The * is a wild card symbol that is used to apply a rule to ALL the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Avoid DRY(Do Not Repeat Yourself) codes by combining multiple selectors into a single CSS rule using commas, thus allowing the declaration to affect all selectors.</li>
          <li>Text-align is a positioning property, one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The image selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>The display property assigned with a BLOCK value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute within a class selector. </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of projects.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>A repository is a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Git allows you to work on branches or workspaces in which you can make changes that will not effect the live site.</li>
          <li>Changes made to a file within the repository (repo), are called Commits.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript(JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. IT allows you to power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces(API) - are built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3d graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li>Third party API's allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, like Twitter and Facebook.</li>
          <li>A VARIABLE is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A STRING is a type of variable that uses a sequence of text enclosed in quotation marks.</ul>
          <li>A CONSOLE refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code functionality.</li>
          <li>A METHOD is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. EX: The '.log("your message")' method will out-put whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>To link a ".js" file to the HTML file, add script src = "./yourfoldername.js"(placed between arrows) under the FOOTER element and above the closing element for BODY.</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools is an indespensibledeveloper's tool that will be used throughout bootcamp and your professional career. It can be accessed by righ-clicking the screen in your browser and selecting INSPECT, or by pressing the CTRL+SHFT+I keys.</li>
          <li>CONTROL FLOW is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, code runs from top to bottom. *NOTE - make sure you define your variables before referencing using a method.</li>
          <li>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS and LOOPS can be used to control the order in which code is executed, or even at all.</li>
          <li>An IF statement is a way introducing decision making into our code, and ELSE IF can be used for more than one condition. This type of statement allows the computer to check if the condition provided is TRUTHY (True), if so it will perform whatever action the code asks. If it is FALSY (untrue), the computer will ignore whate we asked.</li>
          <li>The STRICT EQUALITY OPERATOR === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a boolean result TRUE if the values are equal and FALSE if they are not.</li>
          <li>An ARRAY is a variable used to store a group of related data. EX: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];. Arrays can also store different types of data such as strings "", numbers, boolean, etc.</li>
          <li>An INDEX locates an individual data item inside an array with a unique number (location number). To access one item in an array, start with the variable name followed by the index number of that item in []. EX: shapes[0]. *NOTE - JS as wella s many other languages are ZERO-INDEXED and sequential, which means they start at zero and increase by 1 for each item.</li>
          <li>The FOR loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over again.</li>
          <li>For loops consist of three inportant statements. The first determines the starting point for our loop. EX: var x = 0;. The second is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. Use the LENGTH property to allow the array to execute once for each item in the array. EX: x < shapes.length;. The third is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices are predictable, we know the number increases by 1. EX: x++</li>
          <li>COMMENTING OUT CODE makes a code inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of Js code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A FUNCTION is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It must be called by name in order to execute and does not automatically execute like a FOR loop or conditional statement.</li>
          <li>There are two requirements for a JS function: 1 - Define the function and 2 - Call the function by its name for it to execute. A FUNCTION DECLARATION uses the function keyword in teh function name to define the function. EX: function makeTea() { // code block }. CODE BLOCK or FUNCTION BODY is where we write out instructions for what the function should do. CALL THE FUNCTION to execute or run the function by writing the function name followed by parentheses. EX: makeTea();.</li>
          <li>When debugging your code - follow these tips for common errors: Check variable names to make sure they match the function name, - Check that the index is defined within the {} of the function, - Remeber JS executes from top to bottom, and variables must be defined before other code referencing them.</li>
