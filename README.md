Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

I have always been fascinated with computers and technology. After spending many years in a different industry I realized that working in software development is something I am truly passionate about. Building this study guide will help strengthen my skills and knowledge as a full stack developer. As I continue building upon the information it contains, it will also serve as a way to help me excel in the software industry by developing even better, more creative projects. Used as a point of reference, this guide will provide answers to common coding questions and steps to follow in standard practices like the GitHub workflow. As someone just starting out as a developer, I have learned that even the tiniest mistake can be unforgiving. Remaining vigilant and detail oriented are key components to being a succesful coding. That being said, mistakes are often the best way to grow and learn in a new field. I also learned to MAKE SURE I AM NOT WORKING IN THE MAIN BRANCH OF MY PROJECT!
